# Examples

The repository ships two runnable applications under
[`examples/`](https://github.com/rennf93/tower-guard-rs/tree/master/examples).
Both use the real adapter surface (`GuardLayer` wrapped around a service).

The example crates are workspace members and build against the in-repository
path dependency, so building them locally requires a sibling `guard-core-rs`
checkout (see the repository README).

## simple_app

A minimal guarded service served over hyper
([`examples/simple_app`](https://github.com/rennf93/tower-guard-rs/tree/master/examples/simple_app)):

| Route | Guard | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | excluded | `200 ok`, served before the guard |
| `GET /` | guarded | `200` greeting |
| `GET /search?q=...` | guarded | `200`, or `400` when the query trips the engine |
| `POST /echo` | guarded | echoes the body, or `400`/`413` from the guard |

The `/health` branch runs before the guard, mirroring the excluded-path
behavior of the Python distro's pipeline: the adapter itself scans every
request it sees, so exclusion is a routing decision, not a guard option.

Run it:

```bash
cargo run -p tower-guard-simple-app
```

## advanced_app

A production-shaped guarded service
([`examples/advanced_app`](https://github.com/rennf93/tower-guard-rs/tree/master/examples/advanced_app))
that demonstrates the two knobs a real deployment tunes: environment-driven
engine configuration and route-scoped guard configuration. `/admin/*`
traffic is screened by a second, stricter `GuardLayer` (threat-score
threshold halved by default), while general routes use the default-derived
configuration, and `GET /health` is answered in front of both guards.

### Configuration

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_ADDR` | Listen address | `0.0.0.0:8080` |
| `GUARD_MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` | Engine `max_content_length` | `10000` |
| `GUARD_MAX_FULL_SCAN_BYTES` | Engine `max_full_scan_bytes` (also the default body cap) | `262144` |
| `GUARD_PRESERVE_ATTACK_PATTERNS` | Engine `preserve_attack_patterns` | `true` |
| `GUARD_SEMANTIC_THRESHOLD` | Engine `semantic_threshold` | `0.7` |
| `GUARD_THREAT_SCORE_THRESHOLD` | Engine `threat_score_threshold` (general routes) | `1.0` |
| `GUARD_BODY_CAP` | Adapter body buffering cap | `GUARD_MAX_FULL_SCAN_BYTES` |
| `GUARD_ADMIN_THREAT_SCORE_THRESHOLD` | Threat-score threshold for the `/admin` guard tree | half the general threshold |

### Routes

| Route | Guard tree | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /health` | excluded | `200 ok` |
| `GET /` | general | `200`, greeting text |
| `GET /search?q=...` | general | `200`, or `400` on a threat |
| `POST /echo` | general | echoes the body; `400`/`413` from the guard |
| `GET /admin/stats` | stricter admin guard | screened by a second `GuardLayer` with a lower threat-score threshold |

Run it directly or with the provided Docker setup:

```bash
cargo run -p tower-guard-advanced-app
```

```bash
cd examples/advanced_app
docker compose up
```
