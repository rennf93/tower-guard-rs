description: Use when working in tower-guard-rs (github.com/rennf93/tower-guard-rs), the generic tower::Layer/Service adapter for the guard-core-rs detection engine: editing this crate, planning or reviewing the middleware implementation, wiring guard-core-rs into tower-based stacks (axum, hyper, warp), or answering questions about the repository's status. The repo is currently a 14-line cargo new scaffold with zero dependencies (not even tower or tokio), no engine integration, and no CI that compiles code; everything here must be described as roadmap, not reality.

# tower-guard-rs

Reserved namespace for the generic tower adapter of the Guard ecosystem. Currently a scaffold: `src/lib.rs` is the stock 14-line `cargo new` stub, `Cargo.toml` has no dependencies, and no CI compiles anything.

## Quick Reference

- Status: scaffold, implementation pending. Version 0.0.1, edition 2024, MIT, not published.
- Engine: [guard-core-rs](https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core-rs) (itself pre-1.0).
- Planned as the generic foundation for tower-based stacks (axum, hyper, warp); axum-guard-rs may become a thin convenience over it.
- This adapter holds framework glue only; all security logic belongs in the engine.

## Installation

Not published to crates.io and not usable. To work on the source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rennf93/tower-guard-rs
cd tower-guard-rs
```

## Setup

- Any recent stable Rust (1.85+, edition 2024). No rust-toolchain.toml, no pre-commit config.
- No Makefile and no CI: commands below are the working baseline, and the contribution checklist inside `.github/workflows/greetings.yml` states the intended bar (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests, docs build) that nothing enforces yet.

## Status

What exists: one 14-line stub with an `add()` function and one unit test, automation workflows (greetings, labeler, stale, summary, sync-labels), MIT license, README marked "Reserved namespace. Implementation pending."

What does not exist: any tower, tokio, or guard-core-rs dependency, any `Layer`/`Service` code, any configuration type, any real tests, any CI that compiles the crate. Do not describe this crate as functional, integrated, or published.

## Intended Integration

Roadmap, not reality:

1. Depend on `guard-core-rs` (facade re-exporting `compiler`, `preprocessor`, `semantic`), `tower`, and `http` types.
2. Implement `tower::Layer` producing a `GuardService<S>` wrapping the inner service; inspect each request before forwarding.
3. Per request: extract method, path, headers, client IP, and body; call the engine synchronously (it is CPU-bound, no I/O, no tokio, safe inside `call` without spawning); short-circuit with a 403 response on a threat verdict.
4. Rate limiting, Redis, IP intelligence, and event dispatch are out of scope: they are later sections of the reference spec and not in the engine at 0.0.1.
5. Configuration waits for a config surface in guard-core-rs (reference spec section 02, not yet ported).

Engine honesty constraint: the engine lacks the 4.x pattern-table scan stage, so any integration today is partial; design notes must say so.

## Development Commands

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Footguns

- **Do not add security logic here**: detection belongs in guard-core-rs; this crate is glue only.
- **Do not build on the stub**: `add()` is `cargo new` boilerplate to be replaced, not an API to extend.
- **Do not claim integration or parity**: the engine has no pattern-table scan stage and no config/handler sections yet; never describe this adapter as protecting anything.
- **No CI exists**: nothing validates changes; run the commands above manually.
- **Edition 2024** requires Rust 1.85+; older toolchains fail to build the stub.
