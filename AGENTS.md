## Project Overview

tower-guard-rs is the framework-agnostic Rust adapter for the Guard ecosystem: a [`tower::Layer`](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/trait.Layer.html) plus [`tower::Service`](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/trait.Service.html) that screens `http::Request` traffic through the [guard-core-rs](https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core-rs) detection engine before forwarding it to the wrapped service. It contains no security logic of its own.

- **Repository**: https://github.com/rennf93/tower-guard-rs
- **Language**: Rust, edition 2024, MSRV 1.92
- **License**: MIT OR Apache-2.0
- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Status**: implemented and tested. Not published to crates.io: the engine is a local path dependency until it is tagged (see [Engine Dependency](#engine-dependency)).

## Ecosystem Position

```
guard-core (Python)              <- Reference implementation, spec owner
└── guard-core-rs (Rust engine)  <- guard-core-engine: detect, preprocessor, semantic, compiler
    ├── tower-guard-rs (this)    <- Framework-agnostic tower Layer + Service
    │   └── axum-guard-rs        <- axum wrapper (with_guard), composes this crate
    ├── actix-guard-rs           <- Adapter (scaffold; separate hyper/actix body handling)
    └── rocket-guard-rs          <- Adapter (scaffold)
```

Downstream consumers: `axum-guard-rs` re-exports this crate's `GuardLayer`/`with_guard` path, and any other `tower`-based stack (hyper, warp, tonic) can apply `GuardLayer` directly.

## Boundary Rules

- **No security logic in this crate.** Detection comes from `guard-core-engine`'s `detect`. Policy values (thresholds, caps) are configuration, not logic.
- **No framework dependencies.** This crate depends on `http`, `http-body`, `http-body-util`, `bytes`, `tower`, and the engine. Never add `axum`, `hyper`, `actix-web`, `rocket`, or a tokio runtime dependency to `[dependencies]`. tokio belongs in `[dev-dependencies]` for tests only.
- **No modifications to the engine.** Engine behavior changes are `guard-core-rs` PRs.
- **Fail-secure, always.** A body read error, an engine panic, or a body over the cap must never result in an uninspected passthrough. Failures answer `500` (or `413` for oversize).

## Engine Integration

`guard-core-engine` exposes exactly one detection entry point, which this adapter calls once per request view:

```rust
pub fn detect(content: &str, request_context: &str, config: &DetectConfig) -> DetectVerdict
```

`DetectConfig` has five public fields and **no `Default` impl**; the ecosystem defaults are pinned in `crate::default_config()` (10 000 / 262 144 / true / 0.7 / 1.0), matching the conformance corpus knobs. `DetectVerdict` carries `is_threat`, `threat_score`, `threats`, `original_length`, `processed_length` and **no response shape at all**: the `403`/`413`/`500` translation lives in this adapter (`src/response.rs`) and follows the ecosystem's plain-text error convention (the bare message, `text/plain; charset=utf-8`).

View mapping (documented in `src/lib.rs` and `src/service.rs::scan_views`):

| Request part | Context | Evaluated |
|---|---|---|
| `uri.path()` | `url_path` | when not `/` |
| `uri.query()` | `query_param` | when non-empty |
| header values | `header` | when the name is not excluded |
| buffered body | `request_body` | when non-empty after lossy UTF-8 decode |

The method is not scanned: `detect` has no method parameter. Non-UTF-8 header values are skipped (they cannot be represented as `&str`).

## Engine Dependency

- `Cargo.toml` declares `guard-core-engine = { path = "../guard-core-rs/crates/guard-core-engine" }`.
- **TODO(engine):** switch to the versioned crates.io dependency once `guard-core-rs` is tagged and published.
- The engine crate is used directly, not the `guard-core-rs` facade crate, because the facade re-exports only `compiler`, `preprocessor`, and `semantic`. If the facade later re-exports `detect`, switching is a one-line change.
- CI checks out `rennf93/guard-core-rs` (branch `master`, moving branch by design, documented in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) into `../guard-core-rs` before building, mirroring `laravel-guard`/`symfony-guard`. Do not replace that with a git dependency without updating the CI comment and this file.

## Development Commands

CI is the source of truth (`.github/workflows/*.yml`); there is no Makefile.

```bash
cargo check --all-targets                              # type check
cargo fmt --all -- --check                             # format gate
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings              # lint gate (pedantic is warn, so -D warnings enforces it)
cargo test                                             # unit + integration + doctests (workspace: adapter + examples)
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps         # rustdoc gate
cargo deny check                                       # advisories, licenses, bans, sources (deny.toml)
```

A sibling `guard-core-rs` checkout at `../guard-core-rs` is required for every command.

The example apps under `examples/` build and run like any workspace member:

```bash
docker compose -f examples/simple_app/docker-compose.yml up --build -d --wait    # live smoke stack
SMOKE_PORT=8091 docker compose -f examples/simple_app/docker-compose.yml up ...   # remapped host port
```

The compose stacks also need the sibling `../guard-core-rs` checkout: the
Dockerfile receives the engine source through a compose
`additional_contexts` entry named `engine` pointing at `../../../guard-core-rs`
(relative to the compose file). The `live-smoke` workflow runs the simple_app
stack and the full curl assertion matrix on every push/PR; `upstream-drift`
runs the suite daily against a fresh `guard-core-rs@master` checkout placed at
the path dependency location. `security.yml` runs `cargo deny check` on
push/PR and weekly. `release.yml` gates `v*` tag pushes with the full suite
plus `cargo package --locked`; crates.io publishing is manual and owner-gated.

## Testing

- `cargo test` runs 12 unit tests (`src/`), 13 integration tests (`tests/integration.rs`), and 3 doctests. All must pass.
- Coverage must include: benign passthrough (method/path/header/body preserved byte-for-byte), XSS in body, traversal in path, command injection in query, XSS in a scanned header, an excluded header not scanned, `413` over the cap, body-passthrough under the cap, body read error to `500`, inner service errors propagated unswallowed, engine panic to `500`, and 24 concurrent requests screened independently.
- The engine-panic test uses `GuardLayer::with_detect_fn`, a `#[cfg(test)]`-only seam. Do not expose a public detector-injection API; production must always call `guard_core_engine::detect::detect`.
- Payloads are chosen from the spec 4.0.2 conformance corpus so they are guaranteed threats, not guesses. New blocked-path tests should do the same (see `guard-core-rs/conformance/guard-core-spec-4.0.2/cases/`).

## Code Quality Standards

- `[lints]` in `Cargo.toml`: `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, `clippy::all = "deny"`, `clippy::pedantic = "warn"` (enforced as errors by CI's `-D warnings`). `clippy::nursery` is deliberately not enabled: its lints drift between clippy versions, as `guard-core-rs` found.
- No `#[allow(...)]` in `src/`. The one exception in the sibling repos' policy is test code; prefer fixing the lint.
- rustfmt config is inherited from the repo (`rustfmt.toml` is absent here; default stable formatting applies).
- rustdoc warnings are errors in CI.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep the engine call surface unchanged.** Every request goes through `scan_request` -> `catch_unwind` -> `detect`. Do not bypass the panic recovery.
2. **Do not weaken fail-secure.** Any new failure path must map to `500` or a documented rejection, never to a passthrough.
3. **Keep `EXCLUDED_HEADERS` in sync with `guard-core-ts`'s list** when it changes, and record the reason in the const's doc comment.
4. **Run the full local gate before committing**: fmt, clippy, test, doc, cargo deny. CI runs all five.
5. **Example apps are part of the workspace.** `examples/simple_app` and `examples/advanced_app` build with a plain `cargo build` from the repo root; when you change the adapter's public API or response shapes, update the examples and their READMEs (and re-run the live smoke assertions) in the same change.
6. **Conventional commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `ci:`), matching history. No AI attribution in commit messages.
7. **Document status honestly.** Nothing here is published; say so in the README and crate docs rather than implying a crates.io release. crates.io publishing is manual and owner-gated; the release workflow only gates the tag.
8. **Update the README behavior tables** when the mapping, response shapes, or cap semantics change. The tables are the contract users read.
9. **Keep the engine surface claims honest.** guard-core-rs currently ships the CPU-bound detection pipeline only: no Redis, rate limiter, or ban manager. Do not document capabilities the engine does not expose.
